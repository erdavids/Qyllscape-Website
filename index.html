      <h3>Not to make writing easier, but to make it easier to sit down and write.</h3>
      <p>I started developing Qyllscape because I needed something different, and wanted to make something that I could customize however I wanted.</p>
      <p>Additionally, aesthetics were important to me, and I was spending so much time in writing editors that seemed so separated from the spirit of what I wanted to create. I can't tell you how manty times I searched for "Writing software that looks like a book" and was never able to find something that satisfied me.</p>
      <p>So, Qyllscape </p>
